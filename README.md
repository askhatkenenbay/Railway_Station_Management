# Railway_Station_Management
In this project, teams will implement a system to manage operations at a train station.  The system will need to keep track of arrivals and departures, tickets and availability, delays, maintenance, weather conditions, and so on.  The system will allow role-based access for the roles of station manager, station agent, and passenger.  

    • As a user, I want to see a schedule (with map) of arrivals and departures for a given day
    • As a passenger, I want to search the schedule so that I can book a ticket on given day to a given destination
    • As a passenger, I want to create a profile so that I can review my travel and see upcoming trips
    • As an agent, I want to cancel, create, and change, tickets so that I can fulfill passenger requests
    • As a manager, I want to review the schedules of all station employees so that I can make payroll and adjust hours
    • As a manger, I want to create and cancel routes and issue advisories so that I can ensure that passengers and agents have up-to-date information
